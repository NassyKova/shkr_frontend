### System requirements

- NodeJS version v18.12.1


### Server Installation

- Create a directory called `shkr_front` and navigate into that directory.
  - `$ mkdir shkr_back && cd shkr_back`
- Once in the `/shkr_back` directory, in the terminal run the following command:
  - `git clone git@github.com:Patrick655321/Shakr--Backend.git`
- Install npm packages
  - `npm install`
- If a `.env` file has not been provided to you, create one and fill it out using the fields provided in the `.env.sample` file
- Run the server with the following command:
  - `npm run dev`
- This will run the server using nodemon

The API can now be accessed using Postman and `localhost:3000/`

### Client Installation

- Open the terminal and navigate to the `shkr_front` folder
  - `$ cd shkr_front`
- Once in the `/shkr_front` directory, in the terminal run the following command:
  - `git clone git@github.com:NassyKova/shkr_frontend.git`
- Install npm packages
  - `npm install --legacy-peer-deps`
- run the server with the following command:
  - `npm run dev`
- By default the server will run at `http://localhost:5000/`
